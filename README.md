# HashedHeaps: A Hybrid Data Structure that combines Hash Table and Heap 

## Description:
The `HashHeap` is a data structure designed for efficient management of `(id, priority)` pairs.
It combines a hash table for fast lookup operations and a heap for priority-based operations. This structure supports operations like insertion, deletion, union, and retrieving top `k` elements efficiently.
